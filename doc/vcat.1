.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvcat\fR is a wrapper around
\fBconcat-fuse\fR that allows accessing groups of
files, selected by a glob pattern, as if they were a single
large file. It works by mounting the virtual filesystem
\fBconcat-fuse\fR and then accessing a file within
it that acts as if it contained all the individual files
concatenated.
.PP
\fBvcat\fR is especially useful for doing gapless
playback of video files (when the video format allows it) or for
accessing archive files that have been `split` into multiple
parts and where a temporary file would be to slow, large and
cumbersome to deal with.
.SH EXAMPLE
A simple example of \fBvcat\fR use would look like this:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ echo "File Number One" > /tmp/1.txt
$ echo "File Number Two" > /tmp/2.txt
$ cat $(vcat /tmp/*.txt)
File Number One
File Number Two\*(T>
.fi
.PP
The glob pattern can also provided to \fBvcat\fR
directly instead of being expanded by the Shell, this allows
circumventing:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<bash: /home/ingo/bin/vcat: Argument list too long\*(T>
.fi
.PP
Furthermore \fBtouch\fR'ing the virtual file or
resubmitting the glob pattern will update the virtual file in
case new files have arrived matching the pattern. Note that the
glob pattern needs to be quoted when supplied to
\fB--glob\fR.
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ echo "File Number One" > /tmp/1.txt
$ echo "File Number Two" > /tmp/2.txt
$ cat $(vcat \-\-glob "/tmp/*.txt")
File Number One
File Number Two\*(T>
.fi
.PP
Once done with the virtual file the virtual filesystem can be
unmounted with:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ vcat \-u\*(T>
.fi
