.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBvcat\fR is a wrapper around
\fBconcat-fuse\fR that allows accessing groups of
files, selected by a glob pattern, as if they were a single
large file.
.PP
\fBvcat\fR works by mounting the virtual filesystem
\fBconcat-fuse\fR and then accessing a file within
it that acts as if it contained all the individual files
concatenated.
.SH EXAMPLE
A simple example of \fBvcat\fR use would look like this:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ echo "File Number One" > /tmp/1.txt
$ echo "File Number Two" > /tmp/2.txt
$ cat $(vcat "/tmp/*.txt")
File Number One
File Number Two\*(T>
.fi
.PP
Note that the glob pattern must be quoted for it to work.
.SH BUGS
\fBvcat\fR will only accept a single glob pattern
per call and doesn't provide a way to reorder them.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBconcat-fuse\fR(1),
